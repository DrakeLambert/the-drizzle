## Welcome to Drake's Blog

Hi! I'm Drake Lambert. I'm a software engineer with a love for web technologies and architectural patterns.

I heard somewhere that coming up with blog topics is as easy as identifying challenges overcome. That's what I'll be attempting to post here.

My work usually revolves around [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) and other web technologies, so you can expect to find related content here. Thanks for reading!
